So the plan is to have the root component be CanvasComponent. 
Much like the game animal well and old monster hunter,
I will do away with scrolling map and just have the change at boundaries
I starting with the main page it should have 3-4 doors to go to different pages
Door list:
    Web Dev projects
    School projects
    Data Analytics projects
    About me

Doors can also be clicked on if user is lazy to play the game
AND map should fit in square for mobile use
LOG:
As of (22/06/24): there are 0 doors and 0 links

As of (4/7/24):
    still no doors but platform drawing and platform detection is done ish... 
    now trying to fix the lag for the collision detection
    and move on to implementing clickable surfaces
    and also move onto navigating between pages
    and also clean up code



PRIORITY 
add new maps when avatar goes to edge of map (created 7/7/24)
add clickable link functionality (created 7/7/24)
try host online and open on mobile (created 7/7/24)


try to fix collision issue and why it is laggy (created 4/7/24) (DONE 7/7/24)
also try to fix what happens to avatar when resize (DONE 7/7/24)









abstract avatar and update components so i can start making seperate pages/maps -- ALL BELOW DONE (4/7/24)


I need constants for platforms, doors and avatars
I need functions for:
                1. checking button press
                2. calculating new position
                3. checking collision:
                                    1. avatar and platform
                                    2. avatar and door
                                    3. avatar and boundary
                5. Update display which requires:
                                            1. updating avatar position
                                            2. update map
